      text: Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is the greatest and last prophet in Islam and also the Messenger of Allah. As Allah said in the Quran, "Muḥammad             is not the father of any of your men, but is the Messenger of Allah and the seal of the prophets. And Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of               all things." (Quran 33:40)

      text: Why Zina is Haram?
    - user: Hamza
      text: Zina is one of the major sins in Islam. Zina is haram in Islam. "Narated By Abu Huraira, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, 'Allah has written               for Adam's son his share of adultery which he commits inevitably. The adultery of the eyes is the sight (to gaze at a forbidden thing),               the adultery of the tongue is the talk, and the inner self wishes and desires and the private parts testify all this or deny it.'" (Sahih             Bukhari, Book 63, Hadith 123)

      text: Why should I become Ahmadiyya?
    - user: Hamza
      text: You should not divide into sects as it is prohibited. Allah says in the Quran, "Indeed, those who have divided their religion and become             sects - you, [O Muhammad], are not [associated] with them in anything. Their affair is only [left] to Allah ; then He will inform them               about what they used to do." (Quran 6:159)
